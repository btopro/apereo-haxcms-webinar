<p>HAXcms utilizes a library called <b><a href="https://mobx.js.org/">mobx</a>
</b>
 in order to do its state management. HAXcms (and HAXeditor) follow the design paradigm promoted by Google's Polymer project of <b>Props down, Events up.</b>
</p>
<p>Meaning that in web components, properties / attributes should always be used to convey state down to child elements. Any child elements that need to talk to parents (or parents of parents) should fire events up and allow the parent elements to listen in for events they find relevant.</p>
