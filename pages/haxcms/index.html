<p>So if there's HAXeditor... then what's HAXcms you might ask (the name of the webinar...)?</p>
<p>HAXcms is a CMS built on the concept of what the lightest weight, static CMS could possibly be if...</p>
<ul><li>We have access to the entire <a href="https://webcomponents.org">webcomponents.org</a>
 library</li>
<li>We have HAXeditor as our editing experience</li>
<li>We leveraged both to create highly static, yet engaging websites</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">What you get is the static publishing capabilities of Jekyll, with the theming engine of powerful CMS, with simplicity greater than WordPress. It is a best of breeds solution that is a <b>micro-site factory</b>
. HAXcms is intended to be leveraged to build new websites, and then publish them to a static format that mirrors the dynamic form yet no longer requires a dynamic backend in order to be delivered.</span></p>
<h2><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Where does that leave me...</span></h2>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The result is incredibly small websites that require no maintenance, have high scale (cause they are static...) and are easy to update and theme.</span></p>
