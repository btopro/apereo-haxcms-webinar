<p>There are a few basic ingredients that make up and HAXcms website:</p>
<ul><li>HAXeditor is used to modify the content</li>
<li>Web components make up the body of content</li>
<li>All "content" is housed under a folder in <i>pages/page-slug-here/index.html</i>
</li>

<li>All data of the structure of the site is in a format called JSON Outline Schema and can be found in the <i><a href="https://github.com/elmsln/haxtheweb.org/blob/master/site.json">site.json</a>
</i>
 file at the top level of the website.</li>
<li>All sites are published to a static source and no longer require a back-end in order to operate.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">All HAXcms published sites follow this same pattern</span></p>
