<p>HAXcms requires being published in order to be visible by users. Working locally or on Desktop or on a server is akin to you writing a document on your computer. It's not shared with anyone. Then, when you want to share it with people or update your website, hitting the Publish button is how to do this.</p>

In the future hitting publish will have additional development flexibility.</p>
