<p>HAXcms is predicated on publishing some place. All the edits you see currently are kept in local version control. When you hit the bottom right gear and then publish, that's what makes it live.</p>
<p>In the future we'll have support for multiple publishing endpoints but right now git is supported.<br/>If you want to modify it from github to something else, everything is just JSON and git so... do it... No magic here.</p>
