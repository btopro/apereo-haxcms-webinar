<h2>What is HAX?</h2>
<p>HAX is short for <b>Headless Authoring eXperience</b>

. It is a solution implemented via the web component standard which seeks to create the ultimate authoring solution for the web and implement it in any system (hence headless).</p>
<p>HAX is born out of ELMS:LN and while ELMS:LN implements HAX, HAX works in many modalities.</p>
