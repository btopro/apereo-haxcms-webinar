<p>We'll start with three unique examples (that we've all done).</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://btopro.github.io/testtesttest/">A slide player</a>
. This site is a testbed but illustrates a simple back and forth navigational pattern.</li>

<li><a href="https://btopro.com/">A blog website</a>
, my own blog in fact. This illustrates a simple medium clone, complete with rss/atom feeds.</li>
<li><a href="https://haxtheweb.org">A documentation website</a>
. HAXTheWeb.org is powered by HAXcms, leveraging HAXeditor in order to edit and maintain the content.</li>
<li>For bonus, this website your viewing currently is HAXcms powered and is an alternative documentation / course content theme.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="caret-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">All four websites are powered by the exact same data structure and editing environment. They follow the same publishing workflow (to github pages) and can have their themes radically changed without it affecting content. Their content (via web components) can have accessibility radically improved after publishing without touching the end-point material.</span></p>
