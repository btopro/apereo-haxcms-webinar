<p>Why is Canvas easier to adopt then Sakai?</p>
<p>Why is SquareSpace so popular that people forget it locks them into that platform forever?</p>
<p>Why? Well, because authoring experience is everything. We're all so focused on end users that we forget we are the ones that picked a technical solution for a reason -- it was approachable <b>TO US</b>
